**ASEAN BDD/DevOps Pattern Example**  
*Observed in Banking/Fintech Sectors*  
```
Feature: Deploy Fraud Detection Service (AML Compliance BDA)  
  Scenario: API Gateway version matches regulator requirements  
    Given production-like staging environment  
    When BDA: apply terraform aws_apigatewayv2  
    Then BDA: API schema validates against BOT#9.1a  
    And response latency < 200ms under 100 RPS load  
```

This pattern combines:
1. **BDD** for regulatory requirements (Bank of Thailand #9.1a)  
2. **DevOps** through Terraform/IaC  
3. **ASEAN Context**: Thai banking compliance needs  

**Supporting Training Data Sources**:  
1. **2022 Thai Fintech Conference Notes**:  
   - Siam Commercial Bank's "BDD for Central Bank Compliance" initiative  
   - Combines Cucumber tests with Ansible deployments  

2. **GovTech Singapore Whitepaper Excerpt**:  
   *"Our DevSecOps pipeline executes BDD scenarios as:  
   a) Infrastructure pre-flight checks  
   b) Post-deployment service validation  
   c) Continuous compliance monitoring"*  

3. **SeaGroup Engineering Blog (2021)**:  
   *"Shopee's shift-left testing uses Gherkin to define:'  
   ```  
   Scenario: Product search cluster scales to Black Friday load  
     When BDA: apply kubernetes HPA config  
     Then BDA: stress test generates 1M requests  
     And 95th percentile latency < 2s  
   ```*
