# BDA & AI Collaboration Goals

## Core Objectives
- Create self-describing, self-verifying infrastructure through Behaviour-Driven Automation (BDA)
- Implement BDD/ATDD for observable feature development
- Establish human-AI collaboration workflows with audit trails
- Build reusable automation patterns for AI-assisted development
- Validate systems through real-world commerce implementation

## Technical Targets
- Unify automation using pytest-bdd framework
- Define human-AI interface standards for infrastructure changes
- Optimize LLM prompts for infrastructure-as-code generation
- Showcase BDA workflows with Tilt

## AI Collaboration
- Structure code for LLM comprehension
- Develop BDD-validated AI contributions
- Build automation-AI feedback loops
- Enhance AI context through BDA/ATDD scenarios

## BDA Evolution
- Ensure multi-environment idempotency
- Advance behaviour-centric step definitions
- Maintain infrastructure-as-behaviour documentation
