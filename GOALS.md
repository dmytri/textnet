# Behaviour-Driven Automation & AI Collaboration Goals

## Core Methodological Objectives
- Advance BDA patterns for infrastructure automation
- Develop human-AI collaborative workflows in systems design
- Create reproducible patterns for AI-assisted development
- Validate BDA concepts through real-world commerce implementation

## Technical Demonstration Targets
- Implement pyinfra+pytest-bdd as unified automation framework
- Establish clear AI/human interface conventions
- Optimise prompt engineering for infrastructure-as-code
- Demonstrate Kubernetes-native BDA workflows with Tilt

## AI Collaboration Principles
- Maintain AI-readable documentation standards
- Structure code for LLM comprehension and modification
- Develop test patterns that validate AI contributions
- Implement feedback loops between automation and AI assistants

## BDA Evolution Priorities
- Prove multi-environment idempotency patterns
- Advance behaviour-focused step definitions
- Optimise verification-through-facts methodology
- Establish metrics for BDA system maturity
