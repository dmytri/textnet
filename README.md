# TextNet: The Poem and Prompt Store

TextNet is a text based shop where you can buy poems and prompts that you
access by SSH. It is built with Saleor Commerce and Charm bracelet's TUI
Libraries, including Wish.

Features include those of a normal shop, where you can create an account,
browse products, which are texts like poems and prompts, add products to your
cart, manage your cart and check out.

In addition to the normal commerce features, TextNet has miltivendor features,
as each text product can be contributed by different authors, who recieve a pay
out when people buy their texts.

Currently, authors can not manage their text products on their own, but these
are managed by the TextNet team via Saleor Dashboard.

### Saleor Commerce

TextNet uses Saleor Commerce as its e-commerce engine. This project deploys
both Saleor Core and Saleor Dashboard on a host.

### Behaviour-Driven Automation (BDA)

This project uses Behaviour-Driven Automation for both development and
deployment. Clone locally and use `tilt up` to run your development and test
environment on your Kubernetes cluster (e.g., minikube for local development).

Behaviour-Driven Automation (BDA) extends Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD)
principles to automate processes and workflows. In this project, BDA is used
to:

ðŸ”¹ Deploy an Alpine Linux VPS as a host for our terminal/SSH-based storefront
ðŸ”¹ Use a Kubernetes Job to apply BDA to targets using pytest-bdd

Key components:
- Tilt for automating deployment and local development
- Pytest-bdd for BDA step execution
- Pyinfra for host configuration

### How It Works

The system uses BDA to:
- Provision infrastructure
- Configure environments (development, CI, production)
- Deploy and manage applications

### Getting Started

1. Install prerequisites:
   - Tilt
   - Minikube (or other Kubernetes cluster)

2. Clone the repository

3. Run `tilt up` to start the development environment
