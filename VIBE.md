## Current Issues 
Need to Implement Dashboard Steps

## AI Assistant
- When I ask something like *"what's the vibe?"* Tell me the current focus and issues
- When I say *update the vibe*, if I don't say with what, infer from test results
    - If I do say what, use that
    - If there is a relevant step code, include it
- Never update any files other than this one (VIBE.md) when the topic is the vibe

**Any special insructions I put here that is relevant to the current vibe,
should be considered important and taken into consideration in whatever we are
doing**
