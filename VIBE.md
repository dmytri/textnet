## Current Issues 🐛                                                                                                                                      
**Failure in TNS Scenario: Saleor Version Verification**                                                                                                  
*The TNS scenario, specifically the "TNSV saleor version >= 3.20" step, is failing due to `packaging.version.InvalidVersion: Invalid version: ''`. This   
indicates that the `poetry version` command is not returning a valid version string.*
