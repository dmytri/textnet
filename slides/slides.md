# What is Behaviour-Driven Automation?

- Self-describing, self-verifying infrastructure automation
- Combines BDD (Behaviour-Driven Development) with IaC (Infrastructure as Code)
- Focuses on desired system behaviour, not implementation details
- Creates living documentation that evolves with your infrastructure

---

# Local Development with Tilt & Minikube

- **Tilt**: Modern dev environment orchestrator
- **Minikube**: Lightweight Kubernetes for local development

- **Dev Setup**:
  - BDA tests run in Kubernetes pods
  - Target system deployed as separate container
  - Changes to code trigger automatic redeployment
  - Live logs and debugging information in Tilt UI

# BDA in Practice: Gherkin Syntax

```gherkin
Feature: Saleor Commerce Platform | BDA

  Scenario: Provide Saleor commerce capabilities
    When build tools are available
     And Saleor database is setup
     And Saleor source code is available
     And Saleor Python dependencies are installed
     And Saleor service is enabled
    Then Saleor is operational
```

---

# BDA Implementation with PyInfra

```python
@when("Python runtime is available")
def _(state: State):
    add_op(state, apk.packages, packages=["python3"])
    run_ops(state)

@then("Python version >= 3.12")
def _(host: Host):
    packages: dict = host.get_fact(ApkPackages)
    assert parse(list(packages["python3"])[0]) >= parse("3.12")
```
---

# Benefits of BDA

- **Documentation**: Features and scenarios serve as living documentation
- **Collaboration**: Common language between technical and business teams
- **Reliability**: Consistent, repeatable infrastructure deployments
- **Testing**: Built-in verification of infrastructure state
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and modular design

# BDA vs Traditional Approaches

| Traditional Approach | BDA Approach |
|----------------------|--------------|
| Declare State   | Declare Behaviour |
| Seperate verification  | Self verifying  |
| Separate docs        | Self-documenting code |
| Seperate IaC/CaC| All feature driven |
